#Code Book
  for Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
  
## Overview
  This code book provides a brief overview of the data from the experiements and summarizes the data fields in tidyData.txt.
  
## About the Experiments
  The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
  Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

## Data Package
  The dataset includes the following files:
  - 'README.txt'
  - 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
  - 'features.txt': List of all features.
  - 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
  - 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
  - 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
  - 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
  - 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
  
  
## Tidy Data Set Variables
### activity
  The activity performed by each person:
  - WALKING
  - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
  - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  - SITTING
  - STANDING
  - LAYING
### subjectid
  The unique id for each of the 30 subjects in the experiments. Values are 1 to 30.
### signals
 The remaining variables in tidyData.txt are mean and standard deviation of each of the 33 signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope (66 variables in total)
- timeBodyAcc-XYZ- timeGravityAcc-XYZ- timeBodyAccJerk-XYZ- timeBodyGyro-XYZ- timeBodyGyroJerk-XYZ- timeBodyAccMag- timeGravityAccMag- timeBodyAccJerkMag- timeBodyGyroMag- timeBodyGyroJerkMag- frequencyBodyAcc-XYZ- frequencyBodyAccJerk-XYZ- frequencyBodyGyro-XYZ- frequencyBodyAccMag- frequencyBodyAccJerkMag- frequencyBodyGyroMag- frequencyBodyGyroJerkMag


Note: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
